The termdef utility queries termcap for the current $TERM, and displays the
values that vitapi cares about, for possible inclusion in Caps.cpp.  Use termdef
like this:

    $ TERM=xterm ./termdef
    ...
    $ TERM=xterm-color ./termdef
    ...
    $ TERM=xterm-256color ./termdef
    ...

The number of terminal types supported will be kept to a minimum, but provisions
in the API allow for user-specified types.

The termdef utility is not intended to be part of the regular build, because it
depends on ncurses, which is not a dependency that we want.
