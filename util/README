The termdef utility queries termcap for the current $TERM, and displays the
values that vitapi cares about, for possible inclusion in Caps.cpp.  Use termdef
like this:

    $ TERM=xterm ./termdef
    ...
    $ TERM=xterm-color ./termdef
    ...
    $ TERM=xterm-256color ./termdef
    ...

Currently, these are the only three terminal types planned to be supported.

The termdef utility is not intended to be part of the regular build, because it
depends on ncurses, which is not a dependency that we want.
