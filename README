Vitapi - Visual, Input and Terminal API for simple interaction with modern
terminals.

Vitapi is a library that provides routines that can read keyboard input and
interact with your terminal to provide support for building a character-based
UI.  It supports the mouse and 256 colors.


Q: Should I just use curses/ncurses instead?
A: Perhaps you should.  Vitapi is a lightweight replacement for only some of the
   basic ncurses features, without the legacy terminal support, and with a nice
   color model that includes 256 color support.
